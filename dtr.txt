Defining the Relationship

* Expectations?
Finish the project. Come with one creative extension.
TDD should be a priority.

* Availability?
Karine: Super flexible. Down to stay as late as necessary.
Erin: Flexible. Commute is long(leaving bw 8/9 ideal)

* Communication?
Working together for the most time at a work station. Writing test and refactoring
can be done individually on separate branch. Slack/phone.

* Strengths?
Karina: Typing/workflow. Enumerables.
Erin: TDD.

* Work on?
Karina: Refactoring. Time management.
Erin: Refactoring. Take more pomodoros, ask for help when necessary.

* Features?
Intrigued by drop out rates per demographic/income.

* Git Workflow?
Branches. Branches. Branches.
Don't push things onto origin master until fully functional.
Have small branches per iteration/break things into workable pieces.
Clear expectations for what will happen in each branch. Waffle.

* Problems when implementing?
Don't push it onto origin master until both have consented on the subject.
Utilize resources.

* Feedback?
Immediately when potential feedback noticed.  Don't hold back bc of feelings.
Project first.

* Personal work/communication style?
Take walks while there's still sun out. (Ice cream is nice-- as is eating).
 Stay HYDRATED... and caffeinated.


 WHEN WORKING ON BRANCHES, PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:

 * create branch
 git checkout -b new_branch

 * push it onto git
 git push origin new_branch

 * when branch ready to merge onto master
 Create pull request.
 Accept it.
 git checkout master.
 git pull origin master.
